Note: A proper README remains to be written !
      please send comments to yves@caseau.com and I will update this file 
      until it reaches a proper state :)

This is the main README for the new GitHub distribution of CLAIRE 3.5
WARNING: this readme has not been updated from 3.4 => 3.5
The GitHub organisation follows the file tree directory of the "release" distribution
that I have used for 20 years.

This distribution contains four directories

  - meta: 	contains the self-description of CLAIRE with CLAIRE files (.cl)
  - compile: 	contains the CLAIRE files for the CLAIRE compiler 
  - include:	contains the header files (.h) , most of which are created by the 
                CLAIRE compiler
  - csrc:	contains C++ files, of two kinds
		- the kernel, necessary to create microCLAIRE 
                - the files obtained through the compilation of meta+compile/*.cl


as well as six files:

  - ccmain.cl		A claire file that describes the main/command line for CLAIRE
  - init.cl  		A self-description of the CLAIRE module structure
  - Makefile.nt		A makefile to compile and install CLAIRE on Windows (Visual C++)
  - Makefile.unix	A makefile to compule and install CLAIRE on Linux (GCC)
  - bugLog is the the log file that is produced by fixing bugs (and assigning test cases)
  - the CLAIRE 3.4 documentation


Installation notes
==================

(1) the first step is to copy the files onto a directory, using GitHub or any other approaches
(2) The environment variable CLAIRE3_HOME should be set to this root
(3) select your makefile: Makefile.nt or Makefile.unix according to the OS 
(4) create the subdirectories that are needed:
        objs              
        bin
        bin\public
        bin\public\ntv (for windows) or bin\public\unix (for linux)
        bin\debug
        bin\debug\ntv (for windows) or bin\debug\unix (for linux)
    
(5) nmake, or make, will build claire.exe in three steps

    (a) nmake sclaire.exe  will compile all the C++ files in kernel + csrc to build the first executable.
    (b) nmake cclaire.exe  will recompile ccmain, so that the value of CLAIRE3_HOME is seen by CLAIRE
    (c) the last step is to copy the *.lib files where they should be :)

(6) THIS IS THE MISSING PART:
    CLAIRE 3.5 runs on Unix, MacOS and Windows / both on 32bits and 64 bits architecture
    some flags are necessary ....
    -DCLUNIX, -DCLNOCODE -DCL64 -fwritable-strings
